## Hi there! 🌻 

I'm **Vanessa**, a Brazilian-German software engineering student at **42 Berlin**. I don’t come from a traditional tech background, but I fell in love with programming after completing the **42 Piscine in summer 2023** and starting the **Core Curriculum in November 2023**. 🏊‍♂️

Outside of coding, I’m part of a **book club** with my girlfriends 📚, and I love **working out & trying new sports**. Right now, I’m training for **Hyrox**, a fitness race that challenges both strength and endurance! 💪🔥  

Always open to learning and collaborating — let’s connect! 💫  

Welcome to my page!
